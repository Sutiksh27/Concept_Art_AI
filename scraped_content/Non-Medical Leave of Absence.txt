 Non medical leave of absence

Students who need a non medical leave of absence  also referred to as a personal leave of absence and a NMLOA   which includes any reason that is not medical  will need to apply to the Office of Global Services  OGS  as well as to their college graduate school for this request  Depending on the length of a non medical leave  student s CPT or OPT eligibility may be affected  so we ask that you set up an appointment with an OGS advisor to discuss your specific situation  
      How does a non medical leave of absence affect your F 1 status     
Students who need a non medical leave of absence  also referred to academically as a personal leave of absence   which includes any reason that is not medical  will need to apply to the Office of Global Services as well as to their college graduate school for a leave of absence  The medical condition of a relative does not constitute a medical leave of absence  a medical leave can be granted only if the student has a medical condition 
Additionally  if a student applies for an Emergency Leave from the We Care Office at Northeastern University  www northeastern edu wecare  they must also apply for a non medical leave of absence from the Office of Global Services since federal government regulations recognize only medical and non medical leaves

Frequently Asked Questions
 
                   Can I stay in the U S  if I take a non medical leave of absence                  
No  U S  federal government regulations require that OGS terminate your Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record and that you leave the USA within 15 days of termination of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record 
                   If I stop attending classes before I request a non medical leave of absence from OGS  can I still return to the U S                   
Yes  however  you will not be eligible for the  Reactivation  procedure  since officially asking the Office of Global Services for a leave by appointment or by email is required prior to when you stop attending classes  You would need a new initial I 20 to return in this case 
                   What are the criteria for being eligible for  Reactivation  of my Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record                  
Please review the  Returning from a Leave of Absence Taken Outside the U S   page to see if you meet the criteria 
                   I am trying to decide whether a medical leave or non medical leave would best fit my situation  How can I decide                  
Please read the information regarding medical and non medical leaves on our website  You will see that there are different federal government regulations for each of these leaves  Then make an appointment with an advisor at the Office of Global Services to discuss your plans and options
