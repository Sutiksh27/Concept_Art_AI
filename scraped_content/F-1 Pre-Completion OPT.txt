Students Studying in 
 The United States 
 Applying for Pre Completion OPT  
 F 1 students may apply to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services  USCIS  for Pre Completion Optional Practical Training  OPT  work authorization  which allows actively enrolled students to gain relevant work experience within their field of study   
      Overview     
Optional Practical Training  OPT  is an employment authorization benefit for F 1 students for the purpose of gaining practical experience directly related to their major field of study  It is the responsibility of the student to determine if the accepted employment is related to his her program of study  Students may engage in Pre Completion OPT  or Pre OPT  while actively enrolled in an academic program  To request Pre OPT work authorization  students must 
Request a Pre OPT Recommendation in their SEVIS record from the Office of Global Services
Submit an application to U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services  USCIS  for review and adjudication
Students are eligible for a total of 12 months of Optional Practical Training  OPT  at each degree level  This means that any time for which a student receives Pre OPT authorization will be subtracted from the time available for Post Completion OPT 
Note  Pre OPT work authorization is only available to students when they are actively enrolled at Northeastern  In order to request work authorization post graduation  students must submit an application for Post Completion OPT  
      Eligibility     
A Bachelor s or Master s degree student may be eligible to apply for Pre OPT prior to completion of studies both during the academic year and during the annual vacation period 
PhD students may be eligible to apply for Pre OPT any time during the program of study if all course work other than the thesis dissertation has been completed 
To apply for Pre OPT  all of the following criteria must be met 
Student has maintained valid F 1 student status
Student has studied full time in the U S  for at least 1 academic year
Time spent in language training and non degree programs does not count toward the one academic year requirement
Student has not exceeded 364 days of full time Curricular Practical Training  CPT  at the current degree level
Student has not previously engaged in 12 months of full time Pre  or Post OPT at the current degree level
Student has registered for a full time courseload with appropriate on ground presence during the entire period of requested Pre OPT
This does not apply if the requested Pre OPT will take place during the annual vacation period
      Full time vs  Part time Pre OPT     
A student may be eligible to apply for part time  less than 20 hours per week  or full time  more than 20 hours per week  Pre OPT  Please see below for eligibility requirements for both options 
Part Time Pre OPT  20 or less hours week  
During an academic term
During annual vacation and other official school breaks
Full Time Pre OPT  more than 20 hours week  
During annual vacation and other official school breaks
For PhD students who have completed all coursework except thesis dissertation
NOTE  full time pre OPT is NOT allowed during required academic terms except for certain PhD students as mentioned in the bullet above
      Special Considerations for PhD students     
If a PhD student has completed all coursework but is in the final stages of thesis dissertation  immigration regulations allow the student to apply for either Pre Completion OPT or Post Completion OPT while completing the thesis dissertation 
In this case  the PhD student and his her college need to determine the program completion date  which will be reflected on the I 20 
If you choose to apply for Post Completion OPT while completing your thesis dissertation 
You must fulfill the reporting requirements of Post OPT
The days you do not have a job count towards your 90 days of unemployment time
You cannot request a program extension even if your thesis dissertation is not completed after Post OPT is expired
Note  If you are a student with Stipended Graduate Assistantship  SGA   you must discuss with your department to determine when your SGA will end  The SGA cannot extend beyond the end date as listed on your I 20

      Unemployment During Pre OPT

      Important Reminders     
USCIS must receive the Pre OPT application within 30 days of the issued OPT recommendation by OGS  if the application is not received by USCIS within 30 days after the issuance of the OPT I 20  the application will be denied  this is the most common reason for the denial of Pre OPT 
If your entire application is returned to you  consult with an OGS Advisor before resubmitting the application  your application may not be considered  received  and you may need a new I 20 with OPT recommendation
Do not submit a Pre OPT application to USCIS prior to obtaining an I 20 with the OPT recommendation
Make sure that the address on your OPT application is valid for receiving mail at all times during OPT processing
If you have a pending Pre OPT application and are simultaneously applying for Post OPT  OGS will not issue a Post Completion OPT Recommendation I 20 until 
Your Pre Completion OPT application has been approved by USCIS and you have received your EAD  or
OGS receives confirmation that your application has been withdrawn by USCIS  or was never submitted to USCIS  
      Travel While on Pre OPT     
During Pre OPT  travel restrictions remain the same as they are during normal F 1 study  You should carry the following documents when re entering the U S  
A passport which should be valid for at least six months from the date you return to the U S 
Unexpired F 1 visa
I 20 with a valid travel signature  travel signatures are valid for 1 year

                   I do not have a Social Security Number  When can I apply for one                  
You may apply for a Social Security Number when you apply for your Pre Completion OPT  When filling out the I 765  Field 14 Do you want the SSA to issue you a Social Security card    Check  Yes  and you will receive a SSN with your Pre Completion OPT 
                   How many days of unemployment can I have during Pre Completion OPT                  
There are no restrictions of unemployment during Pre Completion OPT  Students are not required to have a job offer to apply for Pre Completion OPT  however  it is usually advantageous to at least have prospective employment opportunities since any time authorized for Pre Completion OPT is subtracted from the time available for Post Completion OPT  whether the student obtains employment or not 
 
                   I applied for Pre Completion OPT  My application is still pending  but now I want to apply for Post Completion OPT  what do I do                  
If you have a pending Pre OPT application and you would like to apply for Post OPT  then you will need to deduct the entire requested Pre Completion OPT period from your 12 months of Post Completion OPT  If your Pre Completion OPT has been approved  the entire approved period will be deducted from your 12 months of Post Completion OPT 
Part time Pre Completion OPT is deducted at half the rate from your Post Completion OPT  For example  if you are approved for 4 months of part time Pre Completion OPT  then 2 months will be deducted from your 12 months of Post Completion OPT 
                   I am doing Pre OPT and want to do Post Completion OPT right after  Do I have to apply twice or can I apply for both at the same time                  
Pre Completion OPT and Post Completion OPT applications have to be done separately  If you are planning to do both Pre Completion OPT and Post Completion OPT  you will have to apply to the USCIS twice  and pay an application fee each time  
                   It is my last semester and I only have one class to take   can I work full time on Pre Completion OPT                  
During your last semester  even if you are under enrolled  you are still taking required course s   so you can only engage in part time Pre Completion OPT  20 hours per week or less  
 
                   Can I work on campus while I am on Pre Completion OPT                  
Students on Pre Completion OPT can work on campus in addition to working on Pre Completion OPT 
Students cannot engage in a Stipended Graduate Assistantship position while on Pre Completion OPT
