The Secondary Approver  academic advisor  co op coordinator  or SEVIS contact  who receives the application will review the information the student has entered and determine if they approve it academically as either integral or required for program completion  If approved  the Secondary Approver will submit the request to OGS

                                Step 3  OGS reviews completed CPT e form submission

      How CPT affects OPT eligibility     
If an F 1 student exceeds 364 days of full time CPT  more than 20 hours per week at a degree level bachelor s  master s or doctorate   they will lose their eligibility to apply for OPT at that degree level 
When counting CPT days  every day between the start and end date of CPT counts  including the start and end dates   The days that are counted are the days that the student had authorization  not the days the student actually worked  This means even if it was a weekend  holiday  vacation etc   it still counts if the student had CPT authorization 
It is the responsibility of the student to track of how many full time CPT days have been used per degree level  Students can use previously issued I 20s to document this  Students may also request a summary of their CPT authorization history at Northeastern from OGS via this e form 
Part time CPT  20 hours per week or less  does not accrue time towards the 364 day calculation 
Students who require more than 364 days of full time CPT at a degree level to complete their degree program are not in violation of their F 1 status  however they will lose OPT eligibility for the same degree level 
OGS does not keep track and communicate if students will be exceeding the 364 day mark when students are requesting CPT authorization  Students must keep this in mind when requesting CPT authorization 
Please Note  CPT is a benefit of F 1 status  not a guarantee  While students may be able to work up to 364 days while maintaining OPT eligibility  CPT authorization is directly tied to a student s academic curriculum  Therefore  the amount of CPT for which students are eligible and may be authorized is entirely based on their program of study  as well as F 1 federal regulations  Simply because an F 1 student has not engaged in 364 days of full time CPT does not necessarily mean the student is eligible for additional CPT or an extension of a current CPT authorization

      Change of Status and Transfer Students     
Change of status
Full time students who are applying to change their immigration status to F 1 within the U S   application through USICS  or by traveling  via consular processing  may be eligible to use time from a previous immigration status towards accruing benefits  such as Curricular Practical Training  CPT   as long as the student has maintained full time F 1 enrollment requirements 
Please contact OGS to make an appointment with an advisor to discuss CPT eligibility and bring all applicable documentation with you  for example a copy of your I 797 approval notice if you changed status within the U S   
Transfer students
International students with Active F 1 records  who transfer their SEVIS record to Northeastern University  and maintained status  may be able to use accrued time towards the one academic year requirement from the previous institution 
Please contact OGS to make an appointment with an advisor to discuss CPT eligibility and have all applicable documentation available  for example a copy of your official transcript and previous I 20  
Please note  if you transfer to Northeastern on an initial I 20  your one academic year accrual resets as an initial student

                   Can I get Curricular Practical Training for my independent study course                  
Unfortunately  independent study courses do not qualify for CPT authorization 
                   Do I need authorization for an internship  co op etc  that is unpaid                  
Yes  Any work for a course that takes place off campus must have prior authorization  even if this work is unpaid 
                   Is there a limit to the number of hours per week I can work while on Curricular Practical Training                  
In order to know the answer to this  you will need to understand what kind of CPT authorization you have  You can find this information on the second page of your I 20  If your I 20 states you have part time CPT  then this means you can never exceed 20 hours per week  If your I 20 states you have full time CPT  then this means there is no limit to the number of hours per week you can work  However  you must always check with your advisor or co op coordinator to see if they have a limit to the number of hours per week you can work 
                   Do I need authorization for training dates                  
Yes  all training dates require authorization  Remember  just because an opportunity is unpaid does not mean it does not require authorization 
                   How will I know if I have Curricular Practical Training authorization                  
You will know if you have CPT authorization by checking the second page of your most recent I 20  On the second page of your I 20  you will see all the details of your employment authorization 
                   Can I do a co op Internship and take classes at the same time                  
CPT means you must always be enrolled in a course that requires you to be engaging off campus  So  whenever you have CPT authorization  by default you must be enrolled in courses  If you would like to enroll in additional or supplemental courses  to the one that is already requiring you to engage off campus   you must check with your co op department or advisor to see if there are academic or university restrictions that would prevent you from doing so 
                   Can I work on campus while I have Curricular Practical Training                  
Yes  students are allowed to work on campus while they also have CPT  However  students are not allowed to work on an SGA  Stipended Graduate Assistantship  and have CPT at the same time 
Please keep in mind that some coop departments may not allow you to work on campus and be on coop at the same time or may have restrictions on how much on campus employment is allowed while on coop  If this is the case  you will need to follow your coop department s rules 
                   My employer offered to extend my co op internship on a part time basis  Can I do this                  
As a general rule  coop is typically not allowed to be part time  You will need to consult with your coop coordinator to determine if you are eligible to continue part time 
Remember  all CPT  full time and part time  must meet all eligibility requirements  If you wish to extend your CPT authorization on a part time basis  this would need to meet all CPT eligibility requirements listed under our Curricular Practical Training Basics section

                   How can I find out how much Curricular Practical Training time I ve used                  
As a reminder  it is the student s responsibility to keep track of how much CPT time they ve used  Students can see how much CPT time they ve used by looking at past I 20s  Students can also request a screenshot of their current SEVIS record from the Office of Global Services using our Curricular Practical Training Authorization History Request on our Forms and Guides page  This will show students all periods of CPT they have used at their current degree level 
NOTE  The Office of Global Services will not provide students with a count of how much CPT time has been used  The Office of Global Services will only provide a listing of any periods of authorization that have been given  Also  the Office of Global Services is not able to provide information on CPT used at other institutions  Students should contact previous institutions for any CPT time used there 
                   Can my CPT employer be through Northeastern University
