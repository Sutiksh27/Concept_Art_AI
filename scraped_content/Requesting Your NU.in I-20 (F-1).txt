Requesting Your NU in I 20  F 1 
      Helping Students Engage with the World     
The N U in program is an experiential  academic program that expands students  Northeastern education into worldwide locations  Because the first semester of the N U in program is spent outside the U S   international students must read all the information to understand how this will impact their arrival to the U S  when coming to the Boston campus in the spring term after the N U in program 
      I 20 Form for Spring Semester     
The I 20 form is a visa eligibility document issued by Northeastern University to certify that an eligible international student has met admission requirements for a full time program of study and has demonstrated sufficient financial support for his her studies in the U S  This visa eligibility document is needed to apply for a nonimmigrant student visa at a U S  Embassy or U S  Consulate in order to obtain F 1 status within the U S 
NOTE  For students who are participating in N U in outside the United States  the I 20 lists your January program start date  You can enter the U S  as an F 1 student up to 30 days before this date 
Canadian and Bermudian citizens typically do not need visas to study in the U S  However  you do need to request an I 20 and also pay the SEVIS fee 
      What Type of I 20 to Request     
N U in Outside the U S 
New international students who will be attending the N U in program for Fall semester outside of the U S   should request a new initial I 20 for the upcoming spring term  They will start the U S  portion of their degree program in January  The I 20 form will be issued for a January start 
 How to Prepare and Submit an Online Request

Please see the Requesting Your I 20 page of the OGS website 
You will be prompted to enter your myNortheastern username and password login  The myOGS I 20 request e form will respond to your individual situation and guide you through the process  Please ensure that you check  Yes  when asked if you have been admitted to the N U in program for the Fall Semester   Contact the Office of Global Services with any questions 
      What Do I Need to Know About My I 20      
You will be issued a new form I 20 for Spring 2024 when you will be matriculated into your degree program 
International students participating in the N U in program outside of the U S  are not eligible for SEVIS transfer from previous institutions because the difference between the end of their high school program and the beginning of their U S  portion of the N U in Program is more than five months 
Please do not ask your high school to transfer your SEVIS record to Northeastern if you are participating in N U in outside of the U S  Your I 20 from Northeastern will be a new  initial  I 20 with a new SEVIS number  which means that you will need to pay another SEVIS fee and apply for a new F 1 visa 
      Applying for the I 20     
You can submit an initial I 20 request only after you have been admitted to a program at Northeastern University  For many students  this means that you will be able to submit your request prior to your departure to your N Uin program location in the Fall  You will also need to be sure to confirm other requirements needed by the admissions office before your I 20 request submission  At that time  you will then be able to submit an electronic I 20 request through myOGS  OGS encourages you to submit your initial I 20 request as soon as possible  ideally no later than November  to provide ample time for the issuance of the I 20 and your F 1 visa application process prior to your enrollment 
      Applying for the F 1 Visa     
      We recommend that international students apply for an F 1 visa and attend a visa interview in their home country before beginning the N U in program  However  if you are not able to do so  and there is not time to return home prior to the spring semester in the U S   contact the U S  embassy in the country of the N U  in program to check for the possibility of applying for an F 1 visa in the specific N U in location

Step 2  Pay SEVIS I 901 fee online
Step 3  Fill out the visa application online  DS 160 
Step 4  Schedule a visa interview appointment online
Step 5  Go to the visa interview at the U S  embassy
Step 6  Receive the visa stamp on their passport

Note  For the  U S  Point of Contact Information   you can state the name of the Designated School Official  DSO  who signed your I 20 and if you don t know your U S  address  you can state the following address   Northeastern University 360 Huntington Avenue Boston  MA 02115
