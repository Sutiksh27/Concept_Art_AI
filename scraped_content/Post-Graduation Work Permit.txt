Frequently Asked Questions  
Frequently Asked Questions
 
                   Q  Will a part time status on my tax form affect my PGWP                  
If the information on your tax form is incorrect  then that is an issue to resolve with SFS  If you were actually part time during a term  then you may be required to explain this to IRCC on your PGWP application  If you were part time during a regular academic term  then your eligibility for the PGWP may be affected 
IRCC and CRA do not share information except for two situations 
There is an investigation due to suspected fraud 
You have applied for Canadian citizenship and IRCC needs to verify your residency and tax status to support your Citizenship application 
Your PGWP eligibility will be assessed on your enrolment records with the Registrar s Office and on the compliance report that we submit biannually to IRCC 
                   Q  How will co op be shown on my transcript  Will this affect my PGWP application                   
Your co op will be indicated on your transcript in the appropriate term  If you believe that your transcript doesn t properly represent what you were doing each term  then be sure to include a letter of explanation with your PGWP application  As an example  if you took a part time course load while working on co op  and your registration status for that term is showing as part time  then include that information in your letter of explanation with your PGWP application 
                   Q  How are summer breaks shown on my letter of program completion or transcript                   
If your program has a summer break  then this should be shown in the academic calendar for your program  or if you have a modified program  in your course or program map   Studying part time or full time during a scheduled break in your program is fine  and will not affect your PGWP  Courses taken during breaks still need to be the majority on ground  as your program is assessed overall  including studies done during non mandatory terms 
                   Q  Can I get a letter explaining my enrolment status and showing summer breaks                  
You will receive a letter to verify that you have completed your program requirements  to support your PGWP  You will also need to obtain a transcript to submit with your PGWP application  If you have taken a part time course load or an authorized leave or have another unique situation  you would need to explain and document this in a letter of explanation with your PGWP application
