 Deferring Your Program Start 
      About Deferrals     
We at OGS understand that our international students have experienced many obstacles this year  as visa delays and travel restrictions have interfered with study plans  This is a stressful situation  and advisors and leadership at OGS prioritize our students  need and want to ensure that all students have the information that needed in order to make the best decisions about your education 
If you have decided that deferring is the best decision  below you will find some information about how to navigate that process and prepare your record to join NU for the following term 
 Deferral Process 
 1 
 The first step in the deferral process is to communicate with your college  program through your admissions contact  They will need to update your admissions record to reflect your new start date  Please see the links below to discover the process for your program   
  If you are a continuing student  you do not need to contact admissions  Please be in touch directly with your department

 After your admissions contact in your college  program has confirmed your deferral  you will need to request a new I 20 with a new program start date  This is important because it will 1  prevent your SEVIS record from being cancelled if you are not in the US this term and 2  will allow you to travel with current and accurate documents   
Request a new I20 
Requests for I 20s for programs starting in Winter CPS 2024 quarter or Spring 2024 semester will be available from OGS in late September or October 2023   
If you had previously paid for the I 901 SEVIS fee  you will be able to request SEVP to transfer that payment to your new SEVIS record once it has been created
