Frequently Asked Questions
 
                   Am I able to get a program extension after my I 20 program end date has passed                  
No  after your program end date has passed  OGS is no longer able to extend your program  If you believe that you will need a program extension  please make sure that you apply with OGS well in advance  Not extending before your program end date will result in you losing valid F or J status and require corrective action at considerable expense to a student and potential loss of F 1 or J 1 benefits
