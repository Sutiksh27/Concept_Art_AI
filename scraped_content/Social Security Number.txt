 A Social Security Number  SSN  is a 9 digit employee identification number issued by the U S  Social Security Administration  SSA   This page will provide you with necessary information regarding eligibility for an SSN and the application process  
      What is a Social Security Number      
A Social Security Number  SSN  is a 9 digit employee identification number issued by the U S  Social Security Administration  SSA   Eligibility for an SSN is based upon a person s eligibility to work in the United States  Those eligible for a Social Security Number include U S  citizens  permanent residents  and qualified foreign nationals   including  in certain circumstances  students in F 1 or J 1 student status and J 1 scholars  An SSN is required by the U S  government in some cases for tax and employment reporting purposes 
A Social Security Number Card is an important identifying document  Please make sure you keep it in a safe place to avoid identity theft  Do not carry your card with you  Keep it in a safe place with your other important papers  
To learn more about what a Social Security Number is please visit the Social Security website 
Remember  Social Security Numbers are not valid forms of work authorization  Please read the employment section to learn about student and exchange visitor work authorization on and off campus 
      When can I apply for a Social Security Number

After collecting all required documentation  you can apply for your Social Security Number with the Social Security Administration  The Social Security Administration has a few locations in the Boston area  When applying for your Social Security Number  you will need to go in person to one of the Social Security Administration locations 
Generally  there are three convenient locations for Northeastern students studying at the Boston campus

Boston  MA 02222

If you are not located in Boston or Seattle  you can find the nearest Social Security Office near you here 
      How do I apply for a Social Security Number      
BOSTON CAMPUS ONLY
The Social Security Administration  SSA  no longer requires appointments in order to visit an office  and has reverted to the pre pandemic process of accepting applicants on a walk in basis   This means you should no longer mail or fax in documents 
Additionally  the SSA has launched a new online portal  OSSNAP   Online Social Security Number Application Portal allows you to enter your personal information prior to your visit to the SSA  so that when you go to the office  the SSA representative will only need to verify your information and check your documents 
OGS strongly encourages students to complete the online application prior to visiting the SSA office in person   It will save time and speed up the process for you 
Please note that the SSA is only able to process your SSN application up to 30 days prior to your employment start date 
How do I apply for a Social Security Number  SSN  
First  you will need to gain proper documentation from OGS by obtaining one of the following documents 
An on campus employment letter  if you have obtained an on campus job 
F 1 On Campus Employment Authorization Letter Request
J 1 On Campus Employment Authorization Letter Request
A Stipended Graduate Assistantship  SGA  letter  if you have received an SGA from your department 
SGA Social Security Number Letter Request
An I 20 with CPT authorization on the second page  if you have a co op internship etc  
CPT Authorization Request 
The SSA office will not be able to process your SSN application if you do not have the proper documentation from OGS 
Visit OSSNAP   Online Social Security Number Application Portal and start your SSN application by answering the questions online 
After completing the online application  note down the confirmation number  You must take the confirmation number and visit one of the SSA offices  ideally one closest to your residential address  within 45 days  but not more than 30 days before your employment start date 
Please keep in mind that masks are still required inside all SSA offices 
For all other campuses  please continue to contact your local SSA office to understand their process  We will continue to update our website as more information becomes available 
      How long does it take to get a Social Security Number      
It takes about two to four weeks for an Social Security Number card to be issued  You are allowed to start working with just a letter receipt from the Social Security Administration  SSA  stating you have applied for a Social Security Number  However  this is at the discretion of your employer  Typically  if an employer will be doing a background check they will only accept a Social Security Number before you can start working  Please talk with the Human Resources Department of your employer about their policy 
Remember  Social Security numbers are not valid forms of work authorization  Please read the employment section to learn about student and exchange visitor employment on and off campus 
If you receive a notice from the SSA stating that they cannot issue you an SSN because  the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  is unable to verify the immigrant document you submitted as evidence of your lawful visa status   please contact OGS for further assistance
