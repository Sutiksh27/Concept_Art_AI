Academic Training  AT  is employment authorization granted to eligible J 1 Students  It is designed to complement their programs of study in the United States

The total amount of AT cannot exceed the total length of the academic program
AT authorization is location and date specific  The employer s name and address and the employment dates must be authorized in advance by the Office of Global Services  OGS  
      Pre Completion vs  Post Completion Academic Training     
Pre completion AT takes place before the J 1 Student completes all of their degree requirements  Post Completion AT takes place after the J 1 student has completed all degree requirements 
      Eligibility requirements     
A J 1 Student is eligible for Academic Training if they meet the following requirements 
Student has maintained valid J 1 status throughout their program
Student is in good academic standing or has successfully completed program of study
Student is proposing a training experience that is directly related to their field of study and has been approved by the academic advisor or Co op coordinator

Student is maintaining health insurance coverage for themselves and any J 2 dependents
Students in the J 1 Non Degree Student category are not eligible for AT  This includes exchange students participating in a Global Experience Office  GEO  program at Northeastern 
      Time limitations     
J 1 Undergraduate and Master s Degree students are eligible for up to 18 months of AT  this includes both pre  and post completion AT
NOTE  through December 31  2024  the Department of State is allowing extension up to 36 months  or length of degree program  whichever is shorter  for undergraduate and master s degree level students in eligible STEM fields  Please contact OGS for more information 
J 1 Doctoral Degree students are eligible for up to 36 months of AT  this includes both pre  and post completion AT
The total AT period may not exceed the amount of time spent in a full course of study
Example  A Master s student who completed their program in 12 months is only eligible for 12 months of AT
Post AT time begins the day after the program end date on the DS 2019  whether you are working or not
Example  If your program end date is 5 8 2019  you must start counting your post AT time on 5 9 2019  even if you do not start working on that date
It is your responsibility to track your AT usage
Post AT authorization must be processed before the program end date on your DS 2019
Post AT must begin within 30 days after the program end date
Please note  Both full and part time AT deduct at a full time rate  This means that  even if AT authorization is given for work done on a part time basis  each day of part time training deducts a full day from the total amount of time a student is eligible for AT 
 Requesting authorization 
 To participate in an off campus experiential learning opportunity in the U S   J 1 Students must obtain AT authorization from OGS  All students must comply with their college s requirements and policies concerning the timing of eligibility for Co op or other experiential learning opportunity  Please note that individual academic departments or colleges may have additional requirements and regulations for eligibility  OGS will not review any requests for AT that have not already been reviewed by the appropriate advisor

PLEASE NOTE  approval from your academic or co op advisor for an off campus internship co op does NOT mean you are automatically authorized to work off campus  You should not engage in any off campus employment until you receive an authorization from OGS

Frequently Asked Questions  
Frequently Asked Questions
 
                   When do I need authorization
