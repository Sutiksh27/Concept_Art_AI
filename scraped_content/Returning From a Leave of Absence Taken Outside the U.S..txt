Students Studying in 
 The United States 
 Returning From a Leave of Absence Taken Outside the U S  
      How can I return from a leave of absence taken outside the U S       
Once you wish to return to the U S  to resume your studies  you must contact the Office of Global Services  OGS  so that they can either 
Request a reactivation of your SEVIS record with the Student and Exchange Visitor Program  SEVP  or 
Process a new Initial I 20 for you
      Requesting reactivation of your SEVIS record     
      Students who have been outside of the U S  for less than 5 months and who were terminated for Authorized Early Withdrawal  AEW  may be eligible to request the reactivation of their SEVIS record       
Approximately 60 days prior to the start date of the academic term in which you will resume classes  you may submit the OGS e form Return from Non Medical Leave of Absence less than 5 months so that OGS can request reactivation of your SEVIS record  OGS will approve your e form once it has been reactivated  Please note  however  that reactivation is not guaranteed as it is up to the discretion of SEVP   If you are coming back from a Medical Leave of Absence taken outside the U S   you will need to first acquire approval for re entry from UHCS   Also please note that SEVIS will need time to review your reactivation  which is the reason we ask that you submit your request 70 days prior to the start of the term 
After successful reactivation of your SEVIS record  you may return to the U S  as early as 30 days prior to the term in which you will resume classes  You will be able to use your current I 20 and current visa  if it is still valid   If your current F 1 visa has expired  you will need to apply for a new visa once the current SEVIS record has been reactivated 
PLEASE NOTE 
 If you are returning from an MLOA that was taken outside of the country  UHCS will not review your request for re entry until 1 month prior to the start date of the academic term in which you intend to return  Please be sure to contact an OGS advisor to discuss your intent to return so we can establish an appropriate timeline 
To schedule an appointment with an OGS advisor  please call 617 373 2310 or visit our front desk on the Boston campus at 354 Richards Hall 
You must enroll in a full time course load in the term for which you return  even if you return for the summer  You must enroll for the full summer or for both Summer 1 and Summer 2 
      Obtaining a new initial I 20     
      Students who have been outside of the U S  for more than 5 months must request a new Initial I 20       
In order to obtain a new initial I 20  you will need to complete the OGS e form Request for SEVIS I 20 DS 2019 from a Non Medical Leave of Absence of 5 Months or More

If you will be receiving a new initial I 20  you will need to pay the SEVIS fee online  You may or may not need to apply for a new F 1 visa so that you can return to the U S  to resume your program  NOTE  You still need to pay the SEVIS fee even if you do not need to obtain a new F 1 visa stamp  Paying the SEVIS fee is not required for SEVIS records that have been reactivated 
Obtaining a new visa  if needed 
Once you have received your new I 20 and paid the SEVIS fee  you will need to apply for a new F 1 visa stamp in the following circumstances 
If your current F 1 student visa has expired or if it will expire before you return to the U S 
If your current visa bears the name of another educational institution in the U S  rather than Northeastern University
If you have changed your name and if your visa stamp bears your former name
NOTE  OGS recommends that you check with the U S  Embassy or Consulate nearest to you to confirm whether or not you should apply for a new visa  Contact or view the website of the U S  Embassy or Consulate where you would apply for a visa for the most current information on procedures for obtaining an F 1 student visa 
Completing the OGS Online Immigration Clearance after arrival in the U S 
Since you will be entering the U S  on an initial I 20  even though you are not a new student  please note that you will need to complete Online Immigration Clearance with OGS  You will be able to do this by completing OGS Online Immigration Clearance  You will receive an email before classes begin directing you to the link to complete the online form  This is necessary to confirm your arrival to the U S  for government purposes and so that our office can register your arrival in SEVIS 
      Important Reminders      
Returning to the U S  with an Initial I 20 may have an impact upon your eligibility for F 1 benefits such as Curricular Practical Training   CPT  and Optional Practical Training  OPT   Federal regulations require that students complete at least one academic year  two semesters or three quarters  in order to be eligible for CPT or OPT  Please see the CPT and OPT sites for additional information on eligibility
