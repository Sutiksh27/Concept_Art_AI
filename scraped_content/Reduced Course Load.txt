 Reduced Course Load 
 F 1 and J 1 students must enroll in and maintain enrollment in a full time course load during every required academic term  however  federal regulations allow international students to reduce their course load due to specific and limited academic or medical circumstances   
      When is a Reduced Course Load  RCL  Permitted      
The limited exceptions to full time enrollment include  
Medical Conditions 
Final Academic Term of Study 
Academic Difficulties 
Students must obtain approval from the Office of Global Services before dropping below full time enrollment  Failure to do so will result in a violation of status  and may require the termination of your SEVIS record  
      Medical Conditions     
At Northeastern  students must work with The Office of Global Services and University Health   Counseling Services  UHCS  to request a Medical Leave of Absence  this is referred to as a Medical RCL in SEVIS   Please see the Medical Leave of Absence page for more information 
      Academic Difficulties     
Students who are experiencing certain types of academic difficulties  as allowed by U S  federal government regulations  may be eligible for an RCL in their first academic term  
The reasons allowed for an academic difficulty RCL include  
Improper course placement  e g  you registered for a course and then you and or the professor discover that a prerequisite requirement is needed  
Unfamiliarity with American teaching methods 
Initial difficulty with English language 
Initial difficulty with reading requirements 
Please note for an Academic RCL  
Failing a class is not a sufficient reason to apply for a reduced course load
Students must apply to OGS for a reduced course load before dropping below full time status or before registering for a reduced number of courses 
Students must still be enrolled in at least 50  of a full time course load and must continue to maintain on ground presence
A reduced course load for academic difficulties may be taken only once per academic degree level 
Requesting Authorization for an Academic RCL
Student must complete Part 1 of the  Recommendation for Reduced Course Load  form 
Academic Advisor  for undergraduate students excluding CPS  or Authorized Secondary Approver  General Request  for graduate students and all CPS students  must complete Part 2 of the  Recommendation for Reduced Course Load  form 
Student must submit the completed RCL e form to the Office of Global Services  
If the e form does not include a completed Recommendation for Reduced Course Load form  it will be denied  
Wait for OGS approval  Students must not drop their courses until OGS has confirmed that the RCL has been authorized  Confirmation will be sent via email to the student and registrar  
      Final Academic Term     
Students who are in their final academic term of their program of study may not need a full time course load to complete the requirements for their degree  No authorization from OGS is needed in this situation  though we do advise students to confirm with their academic advisor that all graduation requirements have been met  Please see the Final Term page for more information
