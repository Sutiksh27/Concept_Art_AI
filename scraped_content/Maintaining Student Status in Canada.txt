Frequently Asked Questions  
Frequently Asked Questions
 
                   Can I study in a part time course in Canada                    
From an Immigration  Refugees and Citizenship Canada  IRCC  perspective  at a minimum  students must have part time status with their institution to be considered to be actively pursuing their studies  However  one of the eligibility requirements for Post Graduation Work Permit is the student must maintain full time status in every academic session  Part time course load may affect the student qualifying for for Post Graduation Work Permit   
                   How can I prove that I meet the study permit conditions                  
IRCC might ask you to prove you re meeting your conditions  as part of a random check or if they have reason to believe you re not meeting them   
IRCC might ask you for the official documents from the university confirming  
your enrolment status 
the reason for and start date of any leave you ve taken 
the date you withdrew from a school or study program 
the date you were suspended or dismissed from a school or study program 
the date you stopped studying at the school 
official transcripts 
references from people who know you 
proof from a medical professional confirming the medical need for a leave from your study program 
document confirming your school has closed and no longer offers your study program 
any other document an officer finds relevant 
                   What if I am academically dismissed or transferring to another institution  how this will affect my status                   
Student must stop on off campus work if they stop full time studying  including being dismissed from school   
Students engaging in post secondary studies in Canada are authorized to change institutions or programs of study within the same institution  provided they are not limited from doing so by conditions imposed on their study permit   
However  to assess if a student who has changed institutions or programs of study a number of times should be considered to be actively pursuing their studies  the officer should consider the student s reasons for the changes  In cases where multiple program or institutional changes do not appear to support the expectation that the student is making reasonable progress toward the completion of a Canadian credential  the officer may determine that the study permit holder has not fulfilled their study permit condition to actively pursue their course or program of study  
A student should begin or resume their studies at their new institution within 150 days from the day that they ceased or completed their studies at the previous institution  If a student does not resume their studies within 150 days  they should do either of the following  
change their status  that is  change to visitor status or worker status  
leave Canada 
If they do not change their status or leave Canada  they are considered non compliant with their study permit conditions  
                   What does  non compliant  mean                   
Non compliance with study permit conditions may result in enforcement action  that is  an exclusion order can be issued for non compliance  per Canadian Immigration Law   
Non compliance with study permit conditions or engaging in unauthorized work or study may also negatively affect future applications that are made under the IRPA and IRPR  For example  a subsequent study permit or work permit may not be issued until a period of 6 months has passed  since the cessation of the unauthorized work or study or failure to comply with a condition  per Canadian Immigration Law section R221 and subsection R200 3   
                   What if I take a leave of absence from my studies  how will this affect my status                   
Students may be required or may wish to take leave from their studies while in Canada  Office of Global Services Canada does not approve or authorize leave of absence  Students who wish to request leave of absence are strongly recommended to familiar themselves with the immigration implications with regard to taking the leave  For the purpose of assessing if a student is actively pursuing their studies  any leave taken from a program of studies in Canada should not exceed 150 days from the date the leave commenced and must be authorized by their DLI  
Examples of reasons for leave include but are not limited to the following  
medical illness or injury 
pregnancy 
family emergency 
death or serious illness of a family member 
change in program of study within the same institution  outside a regularly scheduled break 
dismissals or suspensions  dependent on degree of severity  
postponed program start date  see Deferred enrollment for more information  
A student on leave who begins or resumes their studies within 150 days from the date the leave commenced  that is  the date the leave was granted by the institution  is considered to be actively pursuing studies during their leave  If a student does not resume their studies within 150 days  they should do either of the following  
change their status  that is  change to visitor status or worker status  
leave Canada 
If they do not change their status or leave Canada  they are considered non compliant with their study permit conditions  
Students studying at Northeastern University Canadian campuses are advised to work with their Academic Advisor if they wish to take the leave  They are also advised to keep a copy of any emails confirmation regarding the authorized leaves that are granted  in case they need it for their PGWP application   
                   What is maintained status                   
Maintained status  formerly called  implied status   refers to a legal extension of an individual s immigration status while waiting for IRCC to process an application for a new permit to remain in Canada  To have maintained status  you must submit your application to IRCC for a new permit before your current status expires  
For continuing students  this means that you may be able to continue to study  and work if eligible  beyond your study permit expiration date as long as you applied to extend your study permit before your previous permit expired
