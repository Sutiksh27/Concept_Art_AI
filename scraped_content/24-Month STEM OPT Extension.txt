 Applying for STEM OPT Extension 
 F 1 students who receive Science  Technology  Engineering  and Mathematics  STEM  degrees and meet the requirements below may be eligible to apply for a 24 month extension of their Post Completion Optional Practical Training  OPT   
          IMPORTANT  Biometrics Appointments are NOT required for Post Completion OPT STEM Extension OPT I 765 Applications        
On July 12th  the USCIS implemented a feature on I 765 applications called  myProgress  that will eventually allow OPT STEM applications to see more detail about their pending applications  Unfortunately  there is currently a glitch with this feature showing a biometrics appointment requirement  Please note that you can disregard this as biometrics appointments are NOT required for I 765 applicants in the C03B and C03C eligibility categories for OPT STEM OPT  Additionally  the estimated processing times are NOT accurate  as this is taking into account estimated times for all types of I 765 applications  not just OPT STEM OPT  
      Eligibility     
All four of the below criteria must be met in order for a student to be eligible for the 24 month Optional Practical Training extension 
Students who are on Post Completion OPT  and
Who have earned a bachelor s  master s  or PhD  certificate programs are not eligible  in a field included on the U S  Department of Homeland Security s list of Science  Technology  Engineering  and Mathematics  STEM  fields within the last 10 years  see below for more details about how to find out if your degree is STEM eligible   and
Who are employed for at least 20 hours per week in a paid job directly related to his her field of study  and
Who are working for an employer that is enrolled in the U S  Government s E Verify program 
STEM Eligible Degrees
To verify STEM eligibility  look at the code listed under  Primary Major  on Page 1 of your I 20 and compare that code in the Classification of Instructional Programs  CIP  column of the U S  Department of Homeland Security STEM Designated Degree Programs list  If your major code is on the list  then it is considered to be STEM eligible 
Please note  the DHS STEM Designated Degree Programs list was recently updated on July 12  2023  Please be sure you are accessing the most recent STEM list linked above  which can also be found on the U S  Immigrations and Customs Enforcement website on this page in the  Resources  section under the  DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List and CIP Code Nomination Process  tab  Students whose CIP code has been added to the list as of July 2023 will receive direct notification from OGS 
          Eligibility Video  
      STEM Extension Application Timeline     
Students may apply to USCIS for the STEM OPT Extension work authorization no earlier than 90 days prior to the Post OPT EAD expiration date  Accordingly  OGS will process a STEM recommendation I 20 no more than three months and three weeks in advance of your current OPT expiration date

      COMPLETING THE FORM I 983      
All students must submit a completed Form I 983 to OGS in order to receive the STEM OPT Extension recommendation on their Form I 20  Students should reference the official USCIS Instructions of the Form I 983 and the resources available on the Study in the States website as they complete the I 983 
Additionally  OGS has prepared a supplemental guide to filling out the Form I 983 to assist students as they complete their application for the STEM OPT Extension  Because the STEM OPT Extension application is a personal petition to USCIS  OGS is unable to advise on how to complete each section of the form  However  this guide offers clarification on some of the I 983 instructions provided by USCIS 
Please Note  All fields on the Form I 983 must be completed in full when you submit your STEM Extension request to OGS  This resource does not provide guidance on how to complete every field of every section of the I 983  rather  it has been created to help guide students through the most frequently questioned sections

Frequently Asked Questions  
Frequently Asked Questions
 
                   Am I eligible for the STEM Extension based on a previous degree                  
Students may be eligible to apply for the STEM Extension based on a previously earned STEM degree from an accredited U S  institution  must be within 10 years of completing the degree  
For example  A student receives a bachelor s degree in Engineering  but did not request STEM OPT employment authorization based on that degree  The student then receives an MBA and obtains authorization for 12 months of Post OPT based on the MBA  This student may be eligible to apply for 24 month STEM OPT at the end of the 12 month Post OPT period based on their MBA 
Any students that believe they are eligible for STEM based on a previous degree should make an appointment with an OGS advisor 
                   Can I be authorized for the STEM OPT Extension more than once                  
The 24 month extension of OPT is available to each student at two non consecutive periods of time   Each STEM extension must meet the above listed STEM eligibility requirements 
Please note  This rule is different from the  standard  12 month OPT  under which students can be approved for multiple OPT periods for each higher degree earned in the U S   i e  bachelor s  then master s  then doctoral  
                   What is the E Verify program                  
E Verify is a database system operated by the Department of Homeland Security in partnership with the Social Security Administration  It allows participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired employees  E Verify is currently voluntary in most states  For more information click here 
                   Where do I mail my STEM application                  
The current filing address is listed below   However its always best practice to confirm the most up to date USCIS Direct Filing Addresses for Form I 765 directly on the USCIS website   It is recommended that you mail your STEM packet through certified mail which includes a tracking number and guaranteed delivery date

                   Can I work while my 24 month application is pending with USCIS                  
Yes  a student who files a timely STEM OPT extension application can continue working while the STEM OPT application is pending  for up to 180 days beyond the expiration of the student s standard post completion OPT  All work done during this 180 day time period is considered STEM OPT extension time that counts towards the 24 month total 
                   Can I change employers while my 24 month application is pending with USCIS                  
It should be noted that changing your employer while applying for STEM can potentially create delays in the application process   However  if you need to change employers while your STEM application is pending with USCIS  please review the instructions in the Reporting STEM Extension OPT section 
                   I received a Request for Evidence from USCIS  What should I do                  
You are required to respond to the RFE by the deadline specified on the letter  If you can prepare the document s  they ask for  you may respond on your own  If you are unsure of how to handle the RFE  please complete the STEM OPT Issue Reporting e form and upload a copy of the RFE 
                   Can I apply for STEM OPT extension if I have a pending H 1B application                  
Yes  you may apply for the 24 month OPT STEM extension while you are also in your period of Cap Gap extension 
If you choose to continue on your 24 month extension rather than change to H 1B  you must ensure your employer requests the withdrawal of your H  1B petition prior to October 1  If this is not done  your H 1B status will begin on October 1  and your eligibility for the 24 month STEM extension will be cancelled 
If you choose to change to H 1B and not proceed with your 24 month STEM extension application  you should send a letter to the USCIS service center reviewing your application and request that your STEM application is withdrawn   Your letter should include your name  SEVIS ID  receipt number  reason for withdrawal  and your signature  in ink  
                   Can I study while on approved STEM OPT                  
Taking a class while on STEM may be permissible as long as your primary activity remains Practical Training   Moving to a new degree program would automatically invalidate your STEM Extension OPT  i e  If you start studying at the PhD level while working on STEM based on a Master s degree  you would invalidate your STEM    Please discuss with an OGS Advisor prior to taking any classes while on OPT or STEM
