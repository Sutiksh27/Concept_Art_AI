Students Studying in 
 The United States 
 Requesting Your I 20  F 1  
 All admitted students who will be studying with an F 1 visa need an I 20 form in order to move forward with the visa process  
      What is an I 20      
An I 20 is a U S  immigration document issued by a university to certify that an F 1 student has met admission requirements and has proof of sufficient financial resources for his her studies  An I 20 is required to apply for an F 1 student visa at a U S  Embassy or Consulate abroad 
Newly admitted international students that have paid a deposit should request an I 20  The Office of Global Services  OGS  encourages you to submit your initial I 20 request as soon as possible because the visa process takes time 
      Who is an Initial student      
New international students coming from outside the U S  that are seeking F 1 visa status 
      Who is a Transfer Student      
If a student currently has an Active Student and Exchange Visitor System  SEVIS  record with another SEVP certified institution in the U S   they may be eligible to transfer their SEVIS record to Northeastern University  Transfer students must 
Request to have their SEVIS record transferred out from their current institution to Northeastern University
Apply for a Transfer I 20 from Northeastern University
TRANSFERRING YOUR RECORD 
It is important that you work with the Designated School Official  DSO  at your current school s international office on the specific process and required documentation needed to complete your transfer out request  As your current school holds your SEVIS record  you must first start the transfer process there  
After completion of the transfer out process  your current institution will set a transfer release date for your SEVIS record  This is the date that your record will be transferred to Northeastern University  In general  your transfer release date has to be within 60 days from the expiration date on your I 20  
Please be sure to confirm with your current school that your record will be transferred to the correct campus at Northeastern  Campus locations include Boston  Seattle  Silicon Valley  Oakland  Arlington  Portland and Charlotte  
Your I 20 form from Northeastern cannot be issued until you complete the required steps of requesting a Transfer I 20 with OGS  In addition  your I 20 cannot be issued until your SEVIS record has been released by your transfer out school to Northeastern  
APPLYING FOR THE TRANSFER I 20 
You can submit a Transfer I 20 request only after you have been officially admitted to a full time program of study   At that time  you will then be able to submit an electronic I 20 request through myOGS  OGS encourages you to submit your Transfer I 20 request as soon as possible to provide ample time for the issuance of the I 20 prior to your enrollment

      Who is a Change of Status student      
If you are currently in the U S  in a non immigrant status  B 1 B 2  F 1  F 2  H 1b or H 4  and would like to change to a different non immigrant status  F 1  F 2  J 1 or J 2   you must apply for a Change of Status I 20  Once you ve received the Change of Status I 20 there are two options  
Option 1  You may travel outside of the U S   apply for a visa at a U S  Embassy with all required materials  and re enter the U S  in the new status  This option is often referred to as Consular Processing  
Option 2  You may apply to the U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services  USCIS  to change your status without leaving the U S  by completing Form I 539 Application to extend change your non immigrant status  This process can take between 6 and 9 months and it is recommended you do not travel while your application is in process  
Please note  If your change of status application is approved by USCIS  option 2   your new F J status will be active  however  you will not receive a corresponding visa in your passport that reflects the new status  As a result  you will need to apply for a new visa stamp at an embassy consulate outside of the U S  in order to re enter the U S  in F J status 
To learn more about change of status and see which option is best for you  please schedule an appointment with an advisor at the Office of Global Services  OGS  by calling  1 617 373 2310

CURRICULAR PRACTICAL TRAINING  CPT  AND OPTIONAL PRACTICAL TRAINING  OPT  
In order to be eligible for both CPT and OPT  you must have maintained full time enrollment with appropriate on ground presence for at least one academic year  One academic year is defined as two semesters or three quarters  It may be possible for you to use your time in another status towards meeting the one academic year
