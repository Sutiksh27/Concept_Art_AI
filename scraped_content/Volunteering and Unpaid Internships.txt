 Volunteering and Unpaid Internships 
 Northeastern University values experiential learning and serving our communities   While volunteering may seem simple  it is actually a complex area in which immigration regulations and labor laws intersect   
      Complexities of volunteering     
If you are interested in volunteering  you must be aware of relevant F 1 and J 1 regulations  so you and the organization do not violate any rules regarding employment authorization  F 1 and J 1 students who are working off campus must be authorized before engaging in the employment  Without proper authorization  off campus employment  including some volunteering  would be considered a violation of your F 1 or J 1 requirements  The consequences may include loss of your F 1 or J 1 status in the U S  making it difficult to reacquire lawful status within the U S  If you are considering engaging in a volunteering opportunity  please make an appointment with an OGS adviser before making plans to begin any activity  
      Volunteering vs  Unpaid Internship     
There is a difference between volunteering and engaging in an unpaid internship 
Volunteering refers to donating time with an organization whose primary purpose is charitable or humanitarian in nature  without remuneration or any other type of compensation  F 1 and J 1 students are allowed to engage in volunteer work as long as it meets this stated criteria  For example  it is permitted for F 1 and J 1 students to volunteer at a local homeless shelter  charitable food pantry  or American Red Cross 
Unpaid internships  on the other hand  do not usually qualify as  volunteer  activity  Internships  both paid and unpaid  are primarily offered by the private sector and related to the intern s major field of study  Therefore  F 1 and J 1 students are advised to seek work authorization prior in order to engage in unpaid internships 
The Department of Labor in the U S  has guidelines for those seeking an unpaid internship  please see here  the  Primary Beneficiary Test  outlined on the Department of Labor s website can be used to determine whether or not the unpaid internship is considered employment 
Because of the consequences of unauthorized employment  we caution all F 1 and J 1 students to consult the Office of Global Services when considering engaging in an unpaid internship or volunteering opportunity  Please make an appointment with an OGS advisor before making plans to begin any activity 
      U S  Department of Labor s definition volunteering     
The Department of Labor is concerned both with the protection of jobs for U S citizens  and with the prevention of exploitation of workers  They have created laws to ensure employment that should be paid is not done for free  While both you and the employer may be happy with an unpaid arrangement  for example  you may be eager to work even on an unpaid basis in a company in order to gain job experience   this may be considered an unfair arrangement in cases where the work is normally performed by a paid person and both the company and the employee are benefiting from the employment 
      How to determine whether an activity is truly volunteering and does NOT require work authorization     
Employment authorization is NOT required when the work performed can be considered volunteering  To be considered volunteering  the work performed by the individual must meet the following criteria 
No compensation or expectation of compensation
The volunteer cannot displace a genuine employee and the services provided by the volunteer should not be the same services for which he or she was previously paid and or expects to be hired and paid for in the future
Services are performed for a non profit charity and the work is  charitable  in nature
Services are performed for a state or local government agency and there is a  civic  purpose to the work
      Volunteering at Northeastern     
If you are a student considering volunteering or engaging in unpaid internships at Northeastern or a staff faculty looking to hire a volunteer or unpaid intern  please review this guidance from Northeastern University Office of General Counsel 
Due to the complexity of U S  labor laws  all university departments  who want to have students volunteer within their department  are advised to thoroughly review this resource  If they have further questions on whether or not the engagement is considered volunteering  they should check directly with the Office of General Counsel

Frequently Asked Questions  
Frequently Asked Questions
 
                   Is it employment or volunteering                  
A common misconception is that the only difference is employees get paid and volunteers do not  However  according to U S  labor laws  there is more to distinguish between employees and volunteers than whether an individual receives a regular paycheck or not  Work that is unpaid may still be considered employment that requires F 1 or J 1 off campus work authorization 
                   Who is considered an employee                  
The definition of an employee used in the context of immigration regulations is as follows   An individual who provides services or labor for an employer for wages or other remuneration   The term  remuneration  is very broad and includes a variety of non monetary benefits  such as free housing  food  gifts  etc 
                   Who is considered a volunteer                  
According to the Department of Labor  volunteers are individuals  who volunteer or donate their services  usually on a part time basis  for public services  religious or humanitarian objectives  not as employees and without contemplation of pay  are not considered employees of the religious  charitable or similar non profit organizations that receive their service   To learn more  click here
