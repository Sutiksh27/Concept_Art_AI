 F 1 Post Completion OPT 
 F 1 students may apply to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services  USCIS  for Post Completion Optional Practical Training  OPT  work authorization  which helps them apply their classroom learning to the real world  
Post Completion Optional Practical Training  Post OPT  is a type of employment authorization adjudicated by U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services  USCIS   It is available to eligible F 1 students for the purpose of gaining practical experience directly related to their program of study  A Post OPT application first requires an OPT recommendation on a student s Form I 20  then a timely application to USCIS for final adjudication  If successful  USCIS will issue an Employment Authorization Document  EAD   
          IMPORTANT  Biometrics Appointments are NOT required for Post Completion OPT STEM Extension OPT I 765 Applications        
On July 12th  the USCIS implemented a feature on I 765 applications called  myProgress  that will eventually allow OPT STEM applications to see more detail about their pending applications  Unfortunately  there is currently a glitch with this feature showing a biometrics appointment requirement  Please note that you can disregard this as biometrics appointments are NOT required for I 765 applicants in the C03B and C03C eligibility categories for OPT STEM OPT  Additionally  the estimated processing times are NOT accurate  as this is taking into account estimated times for all types of I 765 applications  not just OPT STEM OPT  
      Eligibility     
Students may apply for a maximum of 12 months of Post Completion OPT upon completion of each higher degree level  Only one Post Completion OPT application is allowed per academic degree level  i e  Bachelor s  Master s  PhD  
You may apply for Post Completion OPT only if all of the following criteria have been met 
You have maintained a valid F 1 student status
You have been enrolled full time for at least one academic year
You have completed fewer than 365 days of full time Curricular Practical Training  CPT  at the degree level for which you are applying for OPT
You have completed all coursework  may be in final stages of thesis dissertation 
You are inside the U S 
Note  If you depart the U S  before your OPT application has been filed  received and receipted by the USCIS  you become ineligible to apply for Post Completion OPT if your program has ended 
          Eligibility Video  
      Post OPT Application Timeline     
You may apply to USCIS for Post Completion OPT work authorization no earlier than 90 days prior to your program completion date  Post OPT applications cannot be submitted to USCIS later than 60 days after the program completion date  i e  during the 60 day grace period  
OPT Application Timeline
Important reminder about Your Program Completion Date
The program end date on your I 20 is an estimated program end date  which may be different from your actual program end date  You must apply for OPT based on your last registered term  For immigration purposes  program completion date corresponds with the last term of enrollment  not necessarily the date of the graduation ceremony or degree conferral date 
For example  if you finish all of your courses in May  but your degree conferral is in August  your I 20 end date will be a May date if you have no registration over the summer 
PhD student Program Completion Dates
Students in the PhD program may choose the date of completion based on any of the following dates 
Dissertation defense date  or
Dissertation correction submission date  or
End of last registered term
      Choosing Your Post OPT Start Date     
If you have not used any Pre Completion OPT time  you may request up to 12 months of Post Completion OPT  You must request a start date within the 60 day grace period of your program  You select your own start and end date for OPT  even if you do not yet have a job offer  
Here are some general suggestions to help you make the best decision for your situation 
If you have a job offer and your job starts during your 60 day grace period  use the job start date  or earlier  as your requested start of OPT
If you have a job offer and it starts after your 60 day grace period  use the latest date possible  59th day of grace period  for your OPT start date
Reminder  Students are not eligible to begin working until the Post OPT has been approved by USCIS  they have received their EAD  and the start date on the EAD has arrived 
          Application Timeline   Start Date Selection Video  
      Note for PhD Students     
If a PhD student has completed all their coursework but is in the final stages of thesis dissertation  immigration regulations allow the student to apply for either Pre Completion OPT or Post Completion OPT while completing their thesis dissertation 
In this case  the PhD student and their college need to determine the end date of program completion  and the student s I 20 will be updated to reflect it as the completion date of the program 
If you choose to apply for Post Completion OPT while completing thesis dissertation 
You must fulfill the reporting requirements of Post Completion OPT
Days you do not have a job count toward 90 days of unemployment time
You cannot request program extension even if your thesis dissertation is not completed after Post Completion OPT is expired
