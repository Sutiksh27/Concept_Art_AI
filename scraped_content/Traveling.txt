If you are on an F 1 visa  this is the signature at the bottom of Page 2 of your current I 20  A travel signature is valid for 12 months during your academic program  and for 6 months during Post Completion Optional Practical Training 
If you are on a J 1 visa  this is on the bottom right of your DS 2019  A travel signature is valid for 12 months

      How do I register my travel       
Northeastern University highly recommends all students  faculty and staff enter their travel itinerary and housing accommodations abroad in  My Travel Plans   also called the  Travel Registry  
This allows the university to communicate directly with travelers if unexpected events or conditions create pose health or safety risks  In addition  it enables on campus resources and external support providers to better respond to students  faculty  and staff who may need medical or security assistance
