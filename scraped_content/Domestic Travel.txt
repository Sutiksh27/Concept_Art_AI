 As an F 1 or J 1 student  there is so much to learn  explore  and discover in the U S   and the Office of Global Services  OGS  encourages you to do it all  Before you do  please understand what documents you should carry with you when traveling within the the U S  or its territories  
      What you need when traveling in the U S

Form I 20  F visa  or DS 2019  J visa 
Print your most recent I 94 which is your arrival departure record
Any family members traveling with you who have F 2 or J 2 visas should carry the same documents 
Northeastern University requires all students and highly recommends that all faculty and staff enter their travel itinerary and housing accommodations into  My Travel Plans   also called the  Travel Registry  
This allows the university to communicate directly with travelers if unexpected events or conditions create circumstances that might pose health or safety risks  In addition  it enables on campus resources and external support providers to better respond to students  faculty  and staff who may need medical or security assistance
