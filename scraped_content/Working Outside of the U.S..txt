Students Studying in 
 The United States 
 Working Outside of the U S  
 Do you have an opportunity to participate in an international co op or internship outside of the U S   As an F 1 international student  it is important to understand how working outside the U S  may impact your F 1 visa status and in what situations you may need a work authorization  This page will provide you with guidance on working abroad and travel considerations for departing and re entering the U S  during or after your international internship  
      Employment Outside the U S      
Students who are physically located outside of the U S  while working for a non U S  employer do not require work authorization from OGS  Authorization must be given for work that physically takes place within the U S  or takes place abroad but for U S  employers  This may include students on Global Co op 
NOTE  If you are returning to the U S  while working abroad or on international co op to perform work for a short period while you are physically located in the U S   such as a business trip or conference   this would require authorization  Please reach out to OGS for advising if you believe this is your situation 
      Recommended Travel Documents     
As always  when traveling abroad  it is important to make sure you are checking your I 20 before leaving the U S  to see if you will need a new travel signature  Please fill out a Travel Signature Request Form or check our website for travel signature session times and dates 
While it is not required for students to bring any extra documentation  some students going on global co op may want to bring a letter with them when re entering the U S   that explains why they have been outside of the country  Below is a sample letter you may modify and sign yourself to bring with you  In addition  OGS recommends you bring an official transcript with you to show your enrollment in classes while you are abroad 
          Sample Letter
