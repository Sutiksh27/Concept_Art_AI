Students Studying in 
 The United States 
 Study Abroad 
 Northeastern University encourages students to have many global experiences  F 1 students interested in participating in a Northeastern University study abroad program should discuss their plans with the Global Experience Office  GEO  and the Office of Global Services  OGS     
      Getting Started      
There are many reasons why students choose to engage in study abroad opportunities during their degree programs  You can find more information on available study abroad programs and how to connect with a Global Experience Advisor on the GEO website  After confirming admission to a study abroad program  you will need to follow up with OGS to request an I 20 for study abroad  
      When Should You Request An I 20 for Study Abroad      
After you receive your Letter of Enrollment from GEO or the sponsoring Northeastern University Academic Department  you should request an I 20 for study abroad from OGS   You should request the updated I 20 before leaving the U S  to participate in your study abroad program  
      Who Needs an I 20 for Study Abroad      
F 1 students studying abroad during the academic year  will require an updated I 20 with a study abroad remark  Your updated I 20 will be signed for travel and is valid for one year  Please be aware of your program end date on the page 1 of the I 20  If your program end date will occur in less than one year  your travel signature is valid only until the program end date listed on your I 20  
      What You Will Need     
You must have a  Letter of Enrollment  from the Global Experience Office or from the academic department at Northeastern University that is sponsoring the study abroad which confirms the following 
Exact dates of study abroad 
Location  institution  city  country  of study abroad 
After you obtain the letter  please go to Request for SEVIS I 20 DS 2019 
Please note 
A letter from your host institution abroad or other agency company will not be acceptable 
If you study abroad only during the summer term  you do not need to request a study abroad I 20 
      Maintaining Status While Studying Abroad      
You are required to maintain full time enrollment in order to maintain your F 1 immigration status while studying abroad  Any changes in enrollment during your study abroad program could affect your ability to return to the U S  
      Re entering the United States      
At the conclusion of your study abroad program  you should prepare the following documents to re enter the U S  and resume your studies at Northeastern University  
Passport 
Valid F 1 U S  entry visa 
Form I 20 with study abroad remark and travel signature 
Copy of your  Letter of Enrollment  from GEO or from the academic department at Northeastern University that is sponsoring the study abroad program

Please note  
If your F 1 U S  entry visa is expired or will expire while studying overseas  you will need to apply for a new visa before making travel plans to return to the US   If the visa application is denied  you must obtain a new visa in your home country to return to the U S
