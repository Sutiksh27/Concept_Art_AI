If you hold a valid study permit that has been issued to you based on your acceptance to a DLI but you will be transferring to another DLI  including transferring between the two NU Canadian campuses  you need to follow the instructions on the IRCC website and change the DLI number associated with your study permit  
 
3  Apply For a New Co Op Work Permit

For students who have a pending initial study permit application based on the acceptance to another institution but have decided to study at one of the NU Canadian campuses before arriving in Canada  according to IRCC s requirement  you will need to submit a new study permit application using the documentations issued by NU  For more information  please visit the IRCC website information on this topic
