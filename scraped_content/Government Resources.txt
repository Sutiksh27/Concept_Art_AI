      Scam alert   imposter calls      
If someone claiming to be a government official or law enforcement officer calls making threats such as deportation  beware  Hang up and report it 
Here s how it works
A number appears on your caller identification that may look like a legitimate government number  When you answer  the person on the phone poses as a USA Citizenship and Immigration Services or other government official or law enforcement officer  The scammer  or scammers  will say there is a problem with your application or additional information is required to continue the immigration process  Then  they will often ask for sensitive personal and financial information  demand payment  and threaten you with deportation  arrest  or other negative consequences if you do not comply 
The scammer will then order victims to make a payment   and will often order them to go to a nearby bank or store and withdraw money or purchase a prepaid card  gift card  voucher  money order or make some other wire transfer  money exchange  payment or withdrawal   Note that the scammers are often able to direct victims to nearby banks or stores by using online maps to study the area in which a victim resides  
If you receive a call like that  hang up immediately  We will never ask for any form of payment over the phone or in an email  If we need payment  we will mail a letter on official stationery requesting payment  Do not give payment over the phone to anyone who claims to be a USA Citizenship and Immigration Services official  In general  we encourage you to protect your personal information and not to provide details about your immigration application in any public area 
Steps you can take
If you have been a victim of this telephone or email scam  please report it to the Federal Trade Commission  If you receive a suspicious email or voice message and are not sure if it is a scam  forward it to the the USA Citizenship and Immigration Services webmaster at   email protected    We will review the messages received and share with law enforcement agencies as appropriate  Visit the Avoid Scams Initiative for more information on common scams and other important tips 
If you have a question about your immigration record  please call the National Customer Service Center at 800 375 5283 or visit https   my uscis gov appointment to make an InfoPass appointment  You can also use myUSCIS to find up to date information about your application process 
Please report any suspicious call or e mail to the Office of Global Services
