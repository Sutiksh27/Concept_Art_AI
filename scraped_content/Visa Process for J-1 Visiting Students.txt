Please note 
Expedited Appointments  if you make a J 1 visa visa appointment but the appointment date is after your DS 2019 program start date or does not give you sufficient time to arrive in the U S  by the start date  please contact the U S  Embassy Consulate where you will be applying or check their website for their expedited appointment requirements  At many consulates  if you have a DS 2019 with a start date within 60 days and have already made a visa appointment  you may qualify for an expedited appointment 
J 1 Visiting Students must obtain their J 1 visa prior to traveling to the U S  In anticipation of your visa appointment  please follow the J 1 visa application instructions specific to your local U S  Embassy or Consulate  Requirements may differ among Embassy or Consulate locations 
Possession of a DS 2019 does not guarantee a J 1 visa 
Citizens of Canada or Bermuda are not required to obtain a J 1 visa stamp  but they must carry and present their J 1 documents  including the SEVIS fee receipt  when entering the U S 
OGS strongly advises against purchasing flights or making other arrangements prior to receiving your J 1 visa  OGS will not expedite DS 2019 requests based on flights or living arrangements 
      J 1 Transfers to Northeastern     
If your J 1 SEVIS record is being transferred to Northeastern University  you do not need to pay the SEVIS fee again  if you have already paid it  If you are transferring from a U S  government sponsored Exchange Visitor program  indicated by a program code starting with  G   such as G 1 0001  to Northeastern University  you are required to pay the I 901 SEVIS fee upon completion of the transfer process and before applying for a new J 1 visa 
If you are traveling internationally after your transfer to Northeastern is completed  you must plan to apply for a new J 1 visa at a U S  embassy or consulate abroad the next time you travel internationally 
Please note  you can remain in the U S  with the J 1 visa stamp noting the previous institution as long as your new Northeastern DS 2019 remains valid  You do not need to depart the U S  simply to renew the visa stamp unless you have a requirement to travel internationally  Please note that it is not possible to apply for a J 1 visa in the U S 
      Administrative Processing   Visa Denials     
Administrative Processing   Visa Refusals
Although most J 1 visa applications are approved  the outcome of some J 1 visa applications is a refusal under 221 g  or what is commonly referred to as  Administrative Processing   In these cases  the consular officer will convey to the applicant whether the applicant is required to provide any further documentation or information  or whether the case requires additional administrative processing  Please note that this is not a visa denial  Additionally  for J 1 scholars conducting research in certain STEM fields  your application may undergo additional security screening as part of administrative processing  This can often take several months and it is difficult to get updates from the Embassy during that time 
You should follow the instructions on the 221 g  to provide any requested information or documentation  If the 221 g  requires any information directly from Northeastern  or if the 221 g  will delay your arrival to the U S  to start your J 1 program  please contact  email protected  
Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing 
Visa Denials
Although J 1 visa denials are rare  the most common visa denial is under 214 b   which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non immigrant intent  and or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country  family  job  education  property  that indicate they will not immigrate to the U S  and instead will return home after their J 1 program 
The J 1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer s questions  and is typically not a document driven process  Therefore  when a J 1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214 b   Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial 
If your J 1 visa application is denied under 214 b   you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer  You can apply again for the J 1 visa  but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial 
You can also review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa refusals and visa denials 
If you receive a visa denial that will prevent you from coming to the U S  to begin or continue your J 1 program  please email your Northeastern HR contact   faculty supervisor  and copy  email protected  to notify us that you will not be starting your program
