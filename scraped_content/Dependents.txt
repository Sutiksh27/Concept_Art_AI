Students Studying in 
 The United States 
 Dependents 
 Family is important  so that is why the Office of Global Services  OGS  wants to make you aware of what documentation you will need when a family member accompanies you to the U S  
      Basics of F 1 Dependents      
A dependent is a spouse or children  unmarried under the age of 21   If you would like to have dependents accompany you during your study in the U S   you will need to indicate this when completing your I 20 request e form as well as providing the following 
provide a color copy of the identity page of the passport for your dependent s  
show additional funding on your financial documents for your dependents 
For your spouse  add  10 000 to the estimated expenses for your program of study 
For your child children  add  6 000 per person to the estimated expenses for your program of study 
      Applying for F 2 Dependent Visa     
New students may choose to apply for F 2 I 20 s for family members while they apply for their initial I 20 
Also  current continuing students and students on Optional Practical Training may request an I 20 for a dependent by using the Request for Student and Exchange Visitor Information System I 20 DS 2019 
Once your dependent receives their F 2 I 20  they will need to schedule their visa appointment at a U S  Consulate abroad  It may be possible for them to apply for their F 2 visas at the same time that you have an appointment to obtain your F 1 visa  You should check with the consulate you plan to visit for details  It is also possible for your dependent s  to join you in the U S  at a later time  Pay close attention to the important information below 
Dependents do not need to pay a Student and Exchange Visitor Information System  SEVIS  fee
F 2 dependents may not work during their stay in the U S 
Your F 2 spouse may study part time  and F 2 children should attend school full time while you study in the U S 
      Basics of J 1 Dependents     
A J 1 exchange visitor spouse  and unmarried children under the age of 21  are eligible for J 2 status  The day the child turns 21 he or she is no longer eligible for a dependent J 2 status  Each J 2 dependent must have his or her own Form DS 2019  J 2 visa holders do not have to pay the SEVIS fee 
Each J 2 dependent may accompany or follow to join the J 1 exchange visitor in the U S  while the J 1 exchange visitor maintains status  All J 2 dependents are required to comply with applicable federal regulatory requirements  Please see Maintaining J 2 Status section below for more information 
After arriving in the U S   to request DS 2019 for accompanying dependent s   please submit Request for Student and Exchange Visitor Information System I 20 DS 2019  Please note  you may need to show additional funding for dependent expenses 
      Obtaining a J 2 Visa     
Spouse and or children  under age 21  will receive his her own SEVIS generated DS 2019  with his her own SEVIS number 
The J 2 visa may be obtained by bringing the dependent s DS 2019 form and proof of adequate funding to a U S  Consulate 
Proof of marriage for spouse and a birth certificate for each child may be requested for J 2 visa applicants 
You are also required to complete a separate visa application form for each child  even if they are included on a parent s passport 
It is preferred that families apply for J 1 and J 2 visas at the same time  but if the spouse and children must apply separately at a later time  they should bring copies of the student visa holder s passport with the J 1 visa stamp and his her DS 2019 along with all other required documents 
      Maintaining J 2 status     
J 2 dependents may study part time or full time in the U S  while the J 1 exchange visitor is in valid status
J 2 dependents must also be covered by health insurance for the duration of the J 1 program
J 2 dependent children over the age of 21 are no longer eligible for J 2 status and will need to change to another status if they wish to remain in the U S
