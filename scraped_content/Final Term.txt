 Final term 
 In general  F 1 and J 1 students are required to maintain full time enrollment  even in their final academic term  There is an exception  which you can learn about below  
      Final term enrollment     
Some degree seeking students do not have a full course load left to take in their final academic term because they have already completed most requirements for graduation  Students in this situation may be eligible to enroll in less than a full course load during their final term  this includes students completing their program during one of the available summer terms  as long as all of the following criteria are met 
Students must maintain appropriate on ground presence for the duration of their final term via enrollment in on ground classes
Students may not enroll in courses that only occur in the first session of the term and have no course enrollment in second session of the term
Students may not enroll in only online classes
The only exception is for students who intend to finish their program online from overseas
Please also refer to the limitations on online course enrollment
Students must enroll in all remaining courses needed to complete their academic program
Students must understand that the end date on their I 20 will be updated to align with their final term of enrollment
Students who complete their program in Summer 1 will have an I 20 DS 2019 end date that reflects the end of the Summer 1 term  it will not reflect the degree conferral date which occurs at the end of the summer
All students in their final term must notify OGS by submitting the Intent to Complete Program form within 30 days after the start of their final term  This e form alerts OGS to shorten a student s I 20 DS 2019 if your end date occurs in a future term  Remember  your I 20 DS 2019 end date must correspond with your final term of enrollment

Frequently Asked Questions  
Frequently Asked Questions
 
                   I am in my last academic term  Can I take all online courses                  
No  you must follow the instructions in this section for maintaining status in your last term  If your program offers enough online courses for you to complete your degree program online  you could leave the U S  and take your remaining courses from abroad  If you choose to do this  you should let the Office of Global Services know so that we can terminate your Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record  Please note that if you do this  you will not be eligible for Optional Practical Training after this degree and if you wish to attend your graduation ceremony  you would need to return on a tourist visa 
                   If my final term is in the summer can I take my last course online                  
No  even if your last course is taking place during a summer vacation period you must still maintain an on ground presence 
                   Do I have to tell the Office of Global Services that I m dropping below full time in my final semester                  
No  the Office of Global Services does not have to be told if you are dropping below full time  Just make sure that you are also maintaining on ground presence
