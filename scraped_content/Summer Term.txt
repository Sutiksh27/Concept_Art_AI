Frequently Asked Questions  
Frequently Asked Questions
 
                   If I maintain full time enrollment with on ground presence during the summer term s  can this term be considered as accrued time toward eligibility for F 1 J 1 benefits for work authorization                  
Some benefits require you to have been enrolled full time in F 1 or J 1 status for a certain number of semesters quarters in order to be eligible  You may count the summer term towards this requirement if you are enrolled full time in the full summer or in the summer quarter  part time summer enrollment and enrollment in summer 1 or summer 2 only cannot be counted towards eligibility for these benefits  
                   If the summer is not required for me  can I still enroll in classes                  
Yes  You may enroll in both in person and online courses at your leisure  However  if you plan to engage in any practical training opportunities  you must receive employment authorization
