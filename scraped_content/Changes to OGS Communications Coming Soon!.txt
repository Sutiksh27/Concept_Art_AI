 Changes to OGS Communications Coming Soon  
 
 
Dear Northeastern Students and Alumni 
Beginning in mid October  OGS will deactivate its general office email addresses and implement a newly designed inquiry form in our self service portal  
What does this mean  
Instead of sending inquiries to  email protected   questions should be submitted through a new inquiry form that will be available through our self service portal  The self service portal aims to provide resources to students that will assist with answering frequently asked questions  If your question can t be answered utilizing resources in the portal  you will be able to submit the inquiry form for review by the OGS team  This shift in communication method will allow students to receive answers to their questions as quickly as possible   
Which emails will be de activated  
 email protected    email protected    email protected    email protected    email protected    email protected    email protected    email protected    email protected    email protected   
The following emails will remain the active for the following populations  
 email protected   For all J 1 Scholars 
 email protected   For all current international students studying in Toronto or Vancouver 
How will I access this form  
The form will be accessed through the Northeastern service portal  similar to the service portal for ITS and the Registrar  A direct link to the portal will be available throughout the OGS website and embedded in e forms   
When will this change take place  
We will launch the inquiry form in mid October and will deactivate email shortly after  Once the email addresses are deactivated  they will not be monitored and any inquiry to these email addresses will not be received  
Please continue to check your Northeastern email address frequently for updates from OGS  We will send another email to all students once the form is available for use and will include important dates to be aware of throughout this transition   
Please note  This change will not impact other services provided by OGS  including the availability of support via OGS  main phone line for U S  based students or via visit to the Boston office in 354 Richards Hall
