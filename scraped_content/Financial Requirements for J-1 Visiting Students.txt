 Financial Requirements for J 1 Visiting Students 
 The Exchange Visitor Program requires J 1 Visiting Students to demonstrate that they have sufficient funding to support themselves  and any dependents  for the duration of their program  
      Required Minimum Funding     
Please be aware that the minimum funding required per year is the following 
 28 000 for J 1 Visiting Student
 14 000 for spouse
 7 000 per child
The total financial support declared above should match or exceed the estimated living costs of the J 1 Visiting Student and their dependents  if applicable 
IMPORTANT  J 1 Visiting Students can only use personal or family funds for up to 50  of the required minimum funding  This means that more than 50  of the required funding needs to come from Northeastern University  their home institution  or another funding source 
EXAMPLE 
A J 1 Visiting Student with a spouse and two children staying for one year would need to show  28 000 for themselves   14 000 for the spouse  and  14 000 for the children   56 000 in total 
A J 1 Visiting Student would only be able to show half of  56 000  or  28 000  in personal or family funds  They would also need to provide at least  28 000 from Northeastern  their home institution  or another funding source 
      Guidelines for acceptable proof of funds     
Funding from sources other than Northeastern  private sponsor  government funding  scholarships  personal funds  etc   will be considered towards meeting Northeastern s minimum funding requirements  with the following restrictions

If you are providing a bank statement s   it must include the following information 
official English translation

A letter signed by the financial sponsor attesting that the J 1 Visiting Student is entitled to the funds in the sponsor s account
      Sponsorship by home country organizations     
In cases in which the documentation reflects a range in funding  OGS will use the lowest figure in the range  unless the J 1 Visiting Student provides a letter from the funding source indicating otherwise 
If J 1 Visiting Student is sponsored by his her home country employer  e g   during a sabbatical from the home university   the letter from the employer must state that the J 1 Visiting Student will continue receiving a salary while at Northeastern University  salary statement alone is not sufficient
