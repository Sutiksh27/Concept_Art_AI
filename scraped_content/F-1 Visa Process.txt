      Applying for an F 1 Visa     
To provide time for visa processing  students are encouraged to apply for their visa as soon as they receive their I 20 issued by Northeastern University  U S  Embassies or U S  Consulates are able to issue F 1 entry visas up to 365 days before the program start date listed on your I 20 
The U S  Department of State has published estimated Global Visa Wait Times on their website  
In most countries  student visa applicants must appear in person for the visa interview  However  each U S  Embassy or U S  Consulate sets its own interview policies and procedures  Students should consult the specific embassy website or call for application instructions  visit the Website of U S  Embassies  Consulates  and Diplomatic Missions for more information

      F 1 Visa Interview Questions You May Be Asked     
During your F 1 visa interview or at the Customs Control at the port of entry you may be asked questions about your studies  your university choice  how you are planning to pay for your education  your post graduation plans  and more  Here are some of the common questions that you may expect 
What s your purpose for going to the U S  
Why did you choose to study in the U S  
Which University will you attend 
What will be your degree and major 
Did you go to a University at your home country 
What is your occupation at the moment

Please use this guide from NAFSA for your reference  10 Points to Remember When Applying for a Student Visa 
      Expedited Visa Appointments     
U S  Embassies Consulates overseas may be able to expedite your F 1 visa interview date if your I 20 program start date is within 60 days  and there are no available visa interview slots prior to your start date 
The process to request an expedited F 1 visa interview varies by location  You should refer to the instructions on the website of the Embassy or Consulate Visa Section where you will interview  or on their online appointment scheduling site  You will need to provide proof of the need for an earlier appointment  such as your I 20 showing a program start date within 60 days  
Please note  You must first submit the online visa application form  DS 160   pay the application fee  and schedule the first available interview appointment  Only at this point will a consular section consider your request for an expedited appointment 
      Administrative Processing   Visa Denials     
Administrative Processing   Visa Refusals
Although most F 1 visa applications are approved  the outcome of some F 1 visa applications is a refusal under 221 g  or what is commonly referred to as  Administrative Processing   In these cases  the consular officer will convey to the applicant whether the applicant is required to provide any further documentation or information  or whether the case requires additional administrative processing  Please note that this is not a visa denial  You should follow the instructions on the 221 g  to provide any requested information or documentation  If the 221 g  requires any information directly from Northeastern  please contact OGS 
Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing 
Visa Denials
Although F 1 visa denials are rare  the most common visa denial is under 214 b   which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non immigrant intent  and or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country  family  job  education  property  that indicate they will not immigrate to the U S  and instead will return home after their students and any qualifying periods of post completion OPT or STEM OPT 
The F 1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer s questions  and is typically not a document driven process  Therefore  when an F 1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214 b   Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial 
If your F 1 visa application is denied under 214 b   you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer  You can apply again for the F 1 visa  but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial 
You can also review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa refusals and visa denials 
      Entering the U S      
When preparing for your arrival to the U S   you should plan your travel according to the information provided by your college  According to immigration regulations  F 1 student visa holders can enter the U S  up to 30 days prior to the program report date on the I 20 
Students transferring to Northeastern University in F 1 status from another institution or changing their degree level at Northeastern may stay in the U S  or travel between programs  And  they may enter the U S  more than 30 days before the new program start date listed on your I 20 
Documents to Bring When Entering the U S 
Valid passport with an official F 1 visa stamp
Your original I 20 issued by Northeastern University
I 901 SEVIS fee receipt
Financial documents
Admissions letter
At the U S  port of entry  you will be required to present your passport and I 20 to the immigration officer who will stamp your passport  In most cases  the officer notes  D S   Duration of Status  on your passport pages  This means you are allowed to stay in the U S  for the length of time indicated on your I 20  provided that you maintain full time enrollment and a valid F 1 visa status 
Ensure your passport is properly stamped before exiting the immigration inspection area  Do not enter the U S  in visitor status  B 1 B 2  WT  or WB   This status does not permit full time study in the U S 
After your arrival  print your Admission  I 94  number at cbp gov I94 and keep a copy of all travel documents  I 94 information  F 1 visa  and I 20  for your personal records  Ensure your I 94 print out contains the correct information  including F 1 visa status and  Duration of Status
