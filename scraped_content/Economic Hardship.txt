 Economic Hardship 
 During your academic journey at Northeastern University as an F 1 student  you may experience unexpected financial hardship that may affect your ability to successfully maintain progress at the university  If you experience a financial hardship and you are currently studying in the U S  on an F 1 visa  you may request an employment authorization  
      Severe economic hardship employment     
An F 1 student may apply for off campus employment if s he is able to provide evidence of severe  economic need caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond the student s control  When an F 1 student first enters a program of study  s he must provide evidence of financial support in order to obtain an initial Form I 20  However  if there are extenuating circumstances that arise later and are out of the control of the student  s he may be eligible to apply to work off campus for a period of one year 
      Eligibility      
In order to be eligible to apply for employment based on Severe Unforeseen Economic Hardship  a student must 
Be in valid F 1 student status
Have completed 1 full academic year  2 semesters or 3 terms 
Demonstrate that loss of funding is unforeseen beyond the student s control and that off campus work is necessary for the student to continue the academic program
Circumstances that may warrant a reason to apply for Severe Economic Hardship may include  loss of financial aid or on campus employment without fault on the part of the student  substantial fluctuations in the value of currency or exchange rate  inordinate increases in tuition and or living costs  unexpected changes in the financial condition of the student s source of support  medical bills  or other substantial and unexpected expenses   8 CFR 214 2 f  9  ii
